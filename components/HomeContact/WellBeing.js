        The workforce is key to economic growth; however, as the world
        progresses post the COVID-19 pandemic, we have transitioned from a
        Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, and Ambiguous (VUCA) world to a Brittle,
        Anxious, Non-Linear, and Incomprehensible world. Global economics is
        also moving towards circularity; however, with that comes a growing
        range of inequalities encompassing global wealth, income, gender, and
        ecological inequality across the world. In most cases, labour markets
        and systems may be incapacitated to adjust to the changes, which leaves
        the workforce continuing to experience vulnerability. With the belief
        that a safe and enabling work environment is non-negotiable for the
        workforce to thrive, Upfront strives to make systems, capacities, and
        markets stronger and more inclusive to ensure both workforce and
        business wellbeing, but not at the cost of each other.
